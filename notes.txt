**The First Industrial Historian That Learns From You**

NAIA represents a generational leap in industrial data management. While legacy systems (PI, Wonderware, Ignition) require manual modeling every single time, NAIA **remembers** how you organized your last 10 sites and suggests structure for site #11.

**This isn't a "PI replacement."** It's what comes after—a system with institutional memory that compounds over time.
